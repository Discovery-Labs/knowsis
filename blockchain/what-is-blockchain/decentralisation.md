# What is blockchain?

**A Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that shares the storage of the ledger among all participants in the network. The ledger is shared among all participants in order to prevent people spending their money twice \(people “printing their own” online dollars\), and to make sure that transactions are secure and unchangeable, also known as immutable. This means that each block points to the blocks before it, and tampering with any of the data of an already-mined block would invalidate all of the blocks following it. This immutability allows participants in the network to send, receive, and track transactions and assets on the Blockchain network.**

**The first widespread use of a blockchain was in the Bitcoin network, which was the first case of cryptocurrency in the world, and currently the cryptocurrency with the highest price and market cap. Bitcoin uses a mechanism called Proof of Work in order to secure its immutability, making it so that it uses a lot of computer power in order to “mine” transactions and add them to the blockchain permanently. This means that once a block is mined and validated, it becomes very expensive to tamper with any block on the network, as it would require over 50% of the network computing power .At the time of writing, maintaining 50% of network hashrate of the Bitcoin network for 1 hour would cost more than 1.8 million dollars, plus the initial cost of the hardware to do so, which has been estimated at ~$7 billion, assuming the buyer is able to even locate the amount of miners needed to do this.** 

**Due to these security features, blockchain is not only a viable way to create cryptocurrency, but also many other applications that need efficiency, immutability, and credible neutrality.**
