# Smart Contracts

**A smart contract is a program that runs on a computer or a blockchain network only when certain preset conditions are met. For example, a smart contract would easily handle the escrow contract when selling a house. The funds to purchase the house could be sent into the smart contract, with the intention of being delivered to the seller on the condition that the house passes all inspections. If the smart contract receives proof of a passed inspection, it passes the funds to the seller, and passes the title to the buyer. If the house does not pass the inspection, the smart contract could automatically return the funds to the buyer. This entire process \(including the loans if we utilize DeFi\) could be done using smart contracts, and without a bank ever taking ownership of the house or charging absurd fees to sell your own property.**   


 **The most popular smart contracts in the blockchain field are currently in the Decentralized Finance industry, where smart contracts currently hold over $69 billion \(yes, with a B\). Other great future use cases for smart contracts are supply chain management, tracking goods from the second they are created to when they are sold. This would allow accountability and give customers the option to see where the goods they purchase came from. Soon, it could be very possible to know the exact field that those tomatoes you purchased came from, and every tomato from that field could have a digital proof that it was grown by that farmer. All thanks to smart contracts and the blockchain.**
