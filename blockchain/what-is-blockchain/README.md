# Basics Of Blockchain

**In this lesson, we hope to introduce the technology, purposes, and benefits of Blockchain and some of the reasons that it can and should be used to replace many of the antiquated systems we use for many different industries today.**  


**This lesson will use some common “banking terms” such as ledger, as well as a couple of computer science terms like network. These terms can be used in their same general idea as they would typically be thought of in their original industries, but in the context of a group of people, decentralized and distributed around the world. This lesson will use these terms to help you associate their current understanding of the present system with this new and perhaps previously unimaginable technology.**
