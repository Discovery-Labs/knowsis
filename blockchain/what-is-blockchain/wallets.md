# Why Decentralization?

**Decentralization is a very important factor and one of the leading reasons that blockchain was invented in the first place. Bitcoinâ€™s original purpose was to function as Electronic Peer to Peer cash, that eliminated the middleman that was the Central Banks of the world. Decentralization is the easiest way to circumvent censorship, whether that be financial censorship such as tariffs, censorship online such as banning certain websites, or many other different violations of our online privacy that take place due to the internet being centralized by a few large companies that control the entire infrastructure. The main point of decentralization in blockchain is to ensure a trustless system, which creates a system based on credible and provable \(\*literally done by mathematical proofs\*\) neutrality and objectivity across the network.** 

 **Decentralization would allow the individual user to have more control over their individual data, as anything that would be posted from their account would require their personal private key signature, and any data with that unique signature would be fully owned by the individual. This is the first time people have ever truly owned their data online, and will lead to things such as people getting paid themselves directly for the ads that they watch online, rather than giants such as Google making billions in profit selling your search history.**
