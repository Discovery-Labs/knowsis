# Tokens

**Tokens are the asset class of items that are created on the blockchain without the intention of functioning as a currency. While most cryptocurrencies are also technically a token \(for example, Ether is both the currency of the Ethereum network, and a token built on top of the Ethereum network.\) Most tokens in the blockchain industry are built on top of Ethereum, due to the fact that it was the first network to have a reliable virtual machine to run Smart Contracts, which allowed for the creation of token creation standards, such as ERC-20\(coins\) and ERC-721\(NFTs\).**

 **Tokens can perform nearly any function, ranging anywhere from being a currency for a specific protocol and platform, to being a blockchain-verified scarce version of digital art. This is the most popular use case for tokens currently, but considering they are the first verifiable non-fungible and non-replicable asset in the digital world, the excitement for this technology is high. Some of the foreseeable future use cases could be asset tracking on the supply chain, or even attaching the title to a house or car to an NFT, and implicating it in the smart contract sale of a house, as in the example given earlier in the Smart Contracts section.**
