# What Blockchains are There?

**There is an uncountable amount of blockchain networks right now, as evident by reviewing CoinMarketCap.com, or by looking on Coinbase. Many of these blockchains can serve different purposes, ranging anywhere from tracking items on a supply chain to functioning as Digital Gold, which is how many people view Bitcoin now. This multitude of uses is one of the largest advantages to using a blockchain, as nearly every industry can use a network that has the ability to immutably and permanently track transactions, preventing a company from losing track of their goods or assets and being forced to write it off as a loss.** 

 **The most popular blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum, followed by other chains such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Binance Smart Chain. Of these examples given, Bitcoin was the first and is touted as a “digital gold”, followed soon by Litecoin which has occasionally been called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. Dogecoin was created originally as a meme, but has served a great purpose bringing many retail buyers and introducing many people into the crypto industry. Ethereum was the first “smart” blockchain that allowed things like Decentralized Finance and many other new applications, and Binance Smart Chain is the newest of the listed chains, starting off as a fork of Ethereum and building up its own following and user base.**
