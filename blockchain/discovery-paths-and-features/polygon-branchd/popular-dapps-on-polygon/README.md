# Popular Dapps on Polygon

There are many different decentralized applications that users have the ability to explore on the Polygon network. Polygon touts itself as "Ethereum's Internet of Blockchains", and backs that up with the ability for any EVM-compatible Dapp to be deployed on Polygon. For this reason, as well as the cheaper gas fees on the network, there have been a massive number of Dapps migrating over, as well as hundreds of new ones every day that are deploying on Polygon to save money compared to the Etherem mainnet. In this short course, we will preview many of the most popular Dapps that are deployed on Polygon, in preparation to do a further dive and help learners eventually onboard onto any of these applications in the future.
