# Aave

Aave is a decentralised liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in the forms of either a long-term over-collateralized loan, or a one-block liquidity style under-collateralized loan.
