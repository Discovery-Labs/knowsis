# Paraswap

ParaSwap is middleware aggregating many decentralized exchanges \(DEX\) and other services in one comprehensive interface. For any given trade, ParaSwap checks the rates on all supported DEX and implements further optimizations to get the best rate possible - sometimes even beating the markets!

To use Paraswap, the only thing you need is an Ethereum wallet: the website currently supports [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). ParaSwap can also be accessed through third parties services integrating with the Paraswap API.
